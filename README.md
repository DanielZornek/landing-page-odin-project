# Landing Page - for Odin Project challenge

Following the Odin Project's study map, learning flexbox and other things, a basic static page project was proposed, and this is my version of the project.

## How did my version turn out?

- Other information was proposed, such as colors, fonts, sizes, but I ended up fixing some things and it was a little different, but the idea was very faithful to what was requested, I made a page in honor of the characters of 'The Boys', I put the credits in the document, but this project is only for study and portfolio purposes, so I don't think I will have any problems.

- Still talking about what I changed, I took a ready-made palette from the Coolors website, very strong and dark colors to bring this aspect of violence to the work, and I changed the fonts as well, I took it from google fonts.
